UNHCR Attica Mapping Process
==============

## Collecting GPS Data



#### After data collection : submitting GPS data



## Collecting Field Papers data

#### Before data collection

1. Go to the page for each camp. Click "Refresh" in the top right corner.

2. Wait for the field paper to refresh with the latest data. When it's ready, click "Download PDF"

3. Print the PDF. If necessary print multiple copies.

4. If the site has expanded and the old Atlas is not useful, either

* Create your own new one using [these instructions](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/field-papers/
)
* Or contact the mapping team for a new atlas

#### During data collection

**Basic process**

1. Walk across the whole camp.
2. Draw every **new** road, path, building, service, important piece of infrastructure, or other notable feature on the appropriate page of the Field Papers "atlas".
3. If new features are inside of a building, draw a point or area on top of that building where that feature is. So if someone opens a clinic inside one part of a building, draw a point or area where that clinic is. If it's useful draw the approximate outline of the room inside the building.
4. Assign each feature you record a number. In a separate notebook, write down that number and all the important information about that feature.
