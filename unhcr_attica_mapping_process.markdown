## Collecting GPS Data

### Before data collection

1. Charge your phone to 100%
2. Install OSMTracker from the Google Play Store if it's not already installed
3. Turn on Location on your phone
4. Turn on WiFi on your phone
5. Put on plenty of sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses because you're going to be very exposed in the sun

### During data collection

This stage should take 1-2 hours for one person to do in an average sized camp. 
Larger camps and smaller camps may take more / less time, respectively.
GPS data collection can be done offline, although a data plan can help the GPS accuracy.

1. Stand at the entrance to the camp in a place not covered by trees or a roof.
2. Load OSMTracker
3. Click the **+** button to start tracking
4. OSMTracker will say "Waiting for a GPX fix to enable buttons". When it has a fix you will be able to select buttons and the "Accuracy" tab will show an accuracy in meters.

5. If you are walking on a road navigable by car select Way --> Service

<img width=100% alt="Service" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1583376/16880420/d1bb582a-4abd-11e6-9342-f8e951d11e44.png">

6. If you are walking on a path select Track --> Footway

7. Walk down **the center** of _every_ road and path in the camp. This could take a while!
8. Every time you reach a junction (where roads / paths come together), press the button for Service / Path to record that junction. This is important for connecting your roads together after.

9. Take photos regularly while walking. This gives your remote mappers an idea what the area looks like, which helps accurate mapping. The photos should be of buildings, roads, major infrastructure, etc. Not of people!

10. When you arrive at a toilet, office or other major piece of infrastructure lick the Misc/Amenity/Amenity+ button and select the appropriate feature type. If the type doesn't exist, select "Text Note" and type in the feature information.

11. When you're done, press the "Save" button that looks like an old-fashioned floppy disk.

### After data collection : submitting GPS data

Upload the collected data when you're finished collecting. You can do this back at the office if you don't have WiFi or a data connection in the field.

1. Select the track you just created.
2. Go to the options button on the top right

3. Click "OpenStreetMap Upload"

4. If this is your first time, log in to the UNHCR OSM account (see end of this note for login details).

5. Enter the name of the camp on the top row, the name of the camp + the data on the Description (middle) row and _atticacamps_ on the Tag (bottom) row

6. Change the sharing setting from Private to Public

7. Click "Save and Upload"

## Collecting Field Papers data

### Before data collection

1. Go to the page for each camp. Click "Refresh" in the top right corner.

2. Wait for the field paper to refresh with the latest data. When it's ready, click "Download PDF"

3. Print the PDF. If necessary print multiple copies.

4. If the site has expanded and the old Atlas is not useful, either

* Create your own new one using [these instructions](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/field-papers/
)
* Or contact the mapping team for a new atlas

### During data collection

**Basic process**

1. Walk across the whole camp.
2. Draw every **new** road, path, building, service, important piece of infrastructure, or other notable feature on the appropriate page of the Field Papers "atlas".
3. If new features are inside of a building, draw a point or area on top of that building where that feature is. So if someone opens a clinic inside one part of a building, draw a point or area where that clinic is. If it's useful draw the approximate outline of the room inside the building.
4. Assign each feature you record a number. In a separate notebook, write down that number and all the important information about that feature.

**Additional tips**

Clearly label which camp is being mapped on the Field Paper and notebook page(s).

_If there are translations_ : Clearly label which language the inputs are being translated into. Spell out the translation in the native character set, Greek characters and Roman characters if possible.

### After data collection : submitting Field Papers data

At the office, scan each field paper and the corresponding notebook page(s). *Make sure to clearly label which notebook page belongs with which field paper.*

Email the scans to the following email addresses. If necessary, provide any general information about this week's updates in the email.

* rbanick@gmail.com
* hbrown14@gwmail.gwu.edu
* aberdnyk@gwu.edu

Check your email! The mapping team may have questions about words they can't read, etc.
